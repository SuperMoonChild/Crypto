In the Ethereum blockchain, several major protocols have established themselves as leaders in the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending space. These platforms enable users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies in a trustless environment. Here are some of the most prominent Ethereum-based lending protocols:

**AAVE
AAVE is a decentralized finance protocol that allows people to lend and borrow crypto. Lenders earn interest by depositing digital assets into specially created liquidity pools. Borrowers can then use their crypto as collateral to take out a flash loan using this liquidity. AAVE offers several innovative features like uncollateralized loans, "rate switching," and unique collateral types.

**Compound
Compound is an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol designed for developers to unlock a universe of open financial applications. It allows users to deposit cryptocurrencies into a pool and receive cTokens in return, which represent the claim to the portion of the pool plus accrued interest.

**MakerDAO
MakerDAO is best known for creating DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, but it also features a lending platform. Users can lock up assets like ETH to create DAI. This process involves engaging with Makerâ€™s smart contract to manage collateralized debt positions (CDPs), with the operations governed by the Maker community.

**dYdX
dYdX offers a range of DeFi services including margin trading, options, and borrowing and lending. It's distinct in providing decentralized derivatives and perpetual contracts, which are more complex financial products compared to the usual offerings on other DeFi lending platforms.

**Liquity
Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw interest-free loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD (a USD-pegged stablecoin) and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio. The unique feature of Liquity is that it charges no recurring fees and offers low collateral ratios.
